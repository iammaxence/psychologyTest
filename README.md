# Psycology Test

/!\ The software is under development /!\

## Presentation

This software performs a series of projective tests, which are indirect assessment methods based on how a person reacts to non-verbal stimuli, such as pictures, drawings or stories. The patient's responses are then analyzed to reveal information about their unconscious motivations, fears and desires. It also provides detailed reports to help professionals understand the results of their projective tests.
